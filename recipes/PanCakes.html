             <h2> Ingredients </h2>
                <ul>
                     <li> Flour </li>
                     <li> Baking Powder </li>
                     <li> Sugar </li>
                     <li> Butter </li>
                     <li> Salt </li>
                     <li> Milk</li>
                     <li> Eggs </li>
                </ul>

            <h2> Steps </h2>
                <ol>
                    
                    <li>Place flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a bowl, whisk to combine.</li>
                    <li>Add egg, milk and vanilla. Whisk until lump free - no longer than 30 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Heat a non stick skillet - use medium heat if you have a strong stove, medium high if you have a weak one.</li>
                    <li> Add a tiny bit of butter (about 1/2 tsp) and swirl to melt. Use paper towel to mostly wipe the butter off (this is the trick to avoid a dodgy 1st pancake).</li>
                    <li>Pour 1/4 cup batter into the middle of the fry pan (I use a slightly heaped ice cream scoop with lever, standard is 1/4 cup).</li>
                    <li>Swirl pan lightly to spread or use the ice cream scoop edge to spread into 11cm / 4.5" circle (ruler is a must) (joking!).</li>
                    <li>When bubbles rise to the surface (see video), flip and cook the other side until golden.</li>
                    <li>Remove and keep warm in a low oven.</li>
                    <li>Use more butter every 2 to 3 pancakes - depends how good your non stick coating is.</li>
                    <li> Serve with toppings of choice!</li>
                      
                </ol>
